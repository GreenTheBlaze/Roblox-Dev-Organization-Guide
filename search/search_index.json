An example of an erroneous abbreviation would be \"Temp\", which could stand for both \"Temporary\" or \"Temperature\". An example of a good abbreviation could be \"Misc\" which stands for \"Miscellanious\". * Making your game ready for change; have all possibilities thought out for where new instances can go.   - You should however consider the necessities of whatever you're making towards change; don't add directories which are unnecessary if there are alternatives that may fit better for all eventualities. An example of something you shouldn't do is create a \"Scripts\" Folder in <code>Workspace</code>, as although <code>Workspace</code> is able to run server-side Scripts inside of it, <code>ServerScriptService</code> is the most secure place for that purpose, and is designed to house all active server-side Scripts. <code>Workspace</code> is only meant to act as a container for all visible assets.</p>"},{"location":"test-code/","title":"Test","text":"<p>Good:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre> <p>Bad:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre> <p>Exception:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code>print(\"Test\")\n</code></pre>"}]}
