The Roblox Dev Organization Guide by [GreenTheBlaze](https://github.com/GreenTheBlaze) serves as a resource to developers that prioritize the maintainability of their projects!

This guide currently outlines our conventions concerning how developers should organize the Roblox Studio [Explorer window](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/explorer)'s hierarchy with Instances, and also what developers should do to secure the readability of their scripts!

Note that we currently follow the [Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/) in terms of formatting our scripts, but as the guide has yet to fully outline *everything* in full detail (and has missed out a substantial amount of information that could be questioned), this guide will aim to go over some use case scenarios that you should probably follow to keep up with similar expectations as the official style guide contains.
